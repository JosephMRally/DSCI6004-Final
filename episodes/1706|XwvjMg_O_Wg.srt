people make cereal box right here take a

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,970
look on picture-picture and how people

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,950
make cereal

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:56,270
that's a good idea was to make really

61
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,250
when people make cereal they start with

62
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,420
a mixture of flour salt and other

63
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,000
ingredients

64
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,250
that's within the big bag this man uses

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,140
a special crane to move the bag over to

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,680
watch a Gannett container with all the

67
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,959
hot

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,000
but what happens next in a moment he's

69
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,579
going to can open the bottom of the bag

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,209
so that the ingredients can pour out

71
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:27,270
into the hopper was gonna cut that you

72
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:34,280
know he's gonna grag outcomes that must

73
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:37,780
make a lot of serious but surely does

[Music]

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,970
now from the hopper the mixture travels

76
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,460
through some pipes and into the sifter

77
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,220
sifter

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,100
what does a sifter do sometimes the

79
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,139
ingredients get lumpy sister shakes out

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,220
the lump so that the mixture is smooth

81
00:04:53,139 --> 00:05:01,110
almost like sand and everything gets

82
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,740
stirred up some more in this machine

83
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,020
