00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:28,130

like puzzles

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:14,870
it's important to look and listen with

35
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:19,489
your eyes your hands and your ears if

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:23,660
you will look carefully listen carefully

37
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:28,500
you will find a lot of things carefully

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:31,600
look

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,340
and listen

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,100
it's good to look carefully listen

41
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,740
carefully

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:50,070
that's the way you learn a lot of things

43
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:54,360
carefully look and some things you see

44
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:58,500
are confusing some things you hear are

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:02,250
strange but if you ask someone to

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:07,800
explain one or two you'll begin to

47
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:10,920
notice a change in you care

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,140
all the listen carefully

49
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:20,700
that's a way to keep on growing

50
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:24,720
carefully look look and listen

51
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,560
now we're the king the prince and the

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,110
Queen live in the castle in the

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,409
neighborhood of make-believe let's just

54
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:41,440
get the castle

55
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:53,830
and with the castle there

56
00:04:41,440 --> 00:05:00,010
and the factory tree and lives in the

57
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:07,980
tree and who lives in the museum go

58
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:14,150
around playing Fairchild

59
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:16,910
platipus mound and Daniel's clock

60
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,640
and the trolley now we've been

61
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,460
pretending that X the owl is giving

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,470
flying lessons to anyone who wants them

63
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,870
but last time

64
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,500
Lady Elaine said she was going to teach

65
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,930
people to fly because she had a hat with

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,050
a propeller on it so let's think more

67
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:47,780
about that as the trolley goes into the

68
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:50,930
neighborhood of make-believe oh I'm not

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,720
doing well at all trolley

70
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,170

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:02,810
me to do like jump and collins bread and

72
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:04,100
cheer and nothing works i guess i'll

73
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,639
just give up

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:15,460

75
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:19,930

76
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:23,409
something cousin I just said it's no use

77
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,689

78
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,409
could learn to fly

79
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:32,199

but he's a bird align with strong Prince

82
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:45,789
that's right you know tuesday i think

83
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,110
that we should have a picnic and talk

84
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:50,919

85
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,289

86
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,060

142
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:47,209
went down like that

143
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,790

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:53,839
hat on i'll just buy all over the

145
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:58,160

147
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:08,060
hospital when his dad heard that he had

148
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:11,190

154
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:38,220
nothing like magic hats can make a

155
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:42,270
person fly have to be so careful it's

156
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,490
just birds and bats and bees and

157
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:47,500
airplanes and things like that that fly

158
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,600

159
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,820

160
00:11:49,600 --> 00:12:05,080
neighborhood of make-believe next time

161
00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:07,060

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,600
meant any harm

163
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:17,220

beautiful i love the way they move see

168
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:48,140
fish don't have to fly to move

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:54,829
beautifully gracefully through the water

170
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:59,029

274
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,320
I your feelings remind me of when I was

275
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,500
a little girl and I sit next to my

276
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,550
grandmother and at the piano she was a

277
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,640
pianist I come from a very musical

278
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:48,710
family and uncle played trumpet and sax

279
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,260
but my favorite thing was listed with my

280
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,820
grandmother and she would play a song

281
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,590
for me and one of the song she told me

282
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,210
was twinkle twinkle little star

283
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:04,990
so when I play it I think of my

284
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:07,600
grandmother

285
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,200
sing it to me with a twinkle in her eye

286
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,500
was I remember you must be mighty

287
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:19,690
special for you to have that inside

288
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,000
yeah I'll always have mine really i

289
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,150
remember being inspired by a lot of

290
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,870
musicians my my teachers and my parents

291
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:32,140
took me to see woodwind quintet sand big

292
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,960
bands and string quartets I can still

293
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,679
see those musicians on stage in my mind

294
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,860
and my father used to always play the

295
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:46,120
piano and I and he used to really swing

296
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,710
and so sometimes now I can play in my

297
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:57,790
cello and that reminds me of those

298
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:59,770
experiences that all reminds you when

299
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,580

398
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:31,670
it's important to look and listen with

399
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:36,260
your eyes your hands and your ears if

400
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:40,460

407
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:11,140
carefully look and some things you see

408
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:15,309
are confusing some things you hear are

409
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:19,059
strange but if you ask someone to

410
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:25,210
explain one or two you'll begin to

411
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:29,529
notice a change in you care ollie

412
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:33,520

Queen live in the castle in the

417
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:52,179
neighborhood of make-believe let's just

418
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:58,290
get the castle

419
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:59,770
put the castle there

420
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:05,950
and the factory

421
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:15,070
[Music]

422
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:19,600
the tree and lives in the tree and who

423
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:25,400
lives in the museum go around playing

424
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:30,930
Fairchild

425
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:33,720
platipus mound and Daniel's clock

426
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,420
and the trolley now we've been

427
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,270
pretending that X the owl is giving

428
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,280
flying lessons to anyone who wants them

429
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,650
but last time

430
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,310
Lady Elaine said she was going to teach

431
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:49,740
people to fly because she had a hat with

432
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:52,860
a propeller on it so let's think more

433
00:33:49,740 --> 00:34:04,590
about that as the trolley goes into the

434
00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:08,040
neighborhood of make-believe oh I'm not

435
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:10,500
doing well at all trolley

436
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,980

437
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:19,590
me to do like jump and collins bread and

438
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:22,350
cheer and nothing works i guess i'll

439
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:26,389
just give up

440
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:32,269

441
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:36,710

00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:40,099
something cousin I just said it's no use

443
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:42,500

444
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:46,190
he could learn to fly

445
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,980

but he's a bird align with strong prunes

448
00:34:54,409 --> 00:35:02,569
that's right you know tuesday i think

449
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,609
that we should have a picnic and talk

450
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:07,730

508
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:01,720
this what he did just tried to fly and

509
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:05,410
went down like that and he was probably

510
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:10,030
thinking wow with this hat on i'll just

511
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:14,619
buy all over the neighborhood but that's

512
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:17,560
not the way it works now now he has to

513
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:24,369
go to the hospital when his dad heard

514
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:27,960
that he had fallen his dad said I'm

515
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:32,339
going to call the doctor right away

516
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:36,599
when they found out that he had to go to

00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:42,270
the hospital he said we my mom come with

518
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:44,339
me and she said of course they all went

519
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:47,940
off to the hospital

520
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:55,020
nothing like magic hats can make a

521
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:59,070
person fly have to be so careful it's

522
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,290
just birds and bats and bees and

523
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,260
airplanes and things like that that fly

524
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,390
not people

525
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,609

meant any harm

529
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:33,999

530
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:39,360

beautiful i love the way they move see

534
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,920
fish don't have to fly to move

535
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:15,780
