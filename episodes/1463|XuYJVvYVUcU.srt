practice band alright i think the first

94
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,950
thing we should do before we use the

95
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,690
sticks for the drum or the practice pad

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,610
is play with our fingers see if we can

97
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,710
do two single strokes is on the side of

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,460
the practice pan right left

99
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,910
this is something you could do what you

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,729
can do this at home one table top box

101
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,110

alright good now let's try with stickers

106
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,200

well lady Lane said that we couldn't go

286
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,280
to school if we didn't know all the

287
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,070
letters and all the numbers on these

288
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,010
charts and I've tried and drag to learn

289
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,580

291
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,100
but Daniel Lady Elaine is it's just

292
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,050
plain wrong

293
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,020
you don't need to know everything before

294
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:09,089
you begin in fact that's what school is

295
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,870
for to help you to learn not to scare

296
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,569
you

297
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,550
how do you know Wow because i went to

298
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,339
school and I didn't know those things

299
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,709
when i started what was it like it to

300
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:23,630
school

301
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:26,990
Daniel I loved had a teacher who really

302
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:30,649
wanted to be a teacher and every morning

303
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,779
she would welcome us and make us feel as

304
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:36,649
though we were all going on a kind of

305
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:37,909
trip together when someone trips

306
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,220
something soon

307
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:42,830
sometimes we never even thought of we

308
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,130
learned so many things about the world

309
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:51,440
and about different countries people

310
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,740
ships and stars and plain and tracks

311
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,740
yes and trucks and cars and flowers and

312
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,840
about some people like some things like

313
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,640
other things but but what about the

314
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,309
letters and the numbers

315
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,570
oh we learned those too but that was why

316
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:10,039
we were learning that everything else

317
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:12,590
not all by themselves and did you play a

318
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,190
course we played teachers know that

319
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,350
children need to play in fact that's one

320
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,840
of the reasons how Elizabeth cow wanted

321
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,419
to have the school someplace else so

322
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,169
that she could have a big playground you

323
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:29,809
let have sand in it but it probably will

324
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,870
and what will the school be like inside

325
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,120
well there will be chairs that will be

326
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,090
just the right size for children and

327
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,940
young team tigers and there will be

328
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,059
desks it you can put milk on

329
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,669

330
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:50,419

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:59,600
whenever you have to it doesn't sound so

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,340

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,919

of course

375
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:55,730
two plus one equals three now say that

376
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,740
again too when equals something I don't

377
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,520
know why you can't get it

378
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,380
oh hello there a Berlin wailing oh yes

379
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,660
I'd like to talk with you

380
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,460
sorry I don't have time you all are

381
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,890
starting at school tomorrow and I don't

382
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,800
have any of these children ready now to

383
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,500
have children in this neighborhood we're

384
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,410
ready long before you started drilling

385
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,970
them what are you saying I'm saying that

386
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,310
I don't like the way you were

387
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,410
frightening these children you're

388
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:28,520
telling them things are just not true

389
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,830
two plus one equals three is most

390
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,510
certainly true that's right but Anna

391
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,400
doesn't need to know that before she

392
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,260
goes to her first day of school

393
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,440
no she needs to know much more than that

394
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,290
she already knows much more than that

395
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,130
what do you mean Anna knows that she's a

396
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:48,170
growing platipus who wants to learn and

397
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,570
be with other children she already knows

398
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,850
how to play lots of different things she

399
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,340
knows what she likes to eat and what her

400
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,980
favorite toys are what does that have to

401
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,800
do with school it has a lot to do with

402
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:05,150
school a lot to do with learning

403
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,970
I don't understand your pedagogy wanting

404
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,930
to learn is the most important part of

405
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,110
learning

406
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:14,210
I want them to read like my mom and dad

407
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,430
well your teacher will help you learn to

408
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,560
read Anna how can you learn to read

409
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:25,570
without knowing all the letters give the

410
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:28,300
teacher chance Lady Elaine incidentally

411
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,290
what was your first day of school like

412
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,530
mine

413
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,930
oh I had a wonderful time the teacher

414
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,320
had games for us to play and milk to

415
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:40,990
drink all sorts of treats and did you

416
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,920
know all your letters and numbers when

417
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,580
you got there

418
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,990
well not exactly did you have to know

419
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,100
everything

420
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:53,710
not exactly did you have a playground oh

421
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,570
what a fabulous playground we had I

422
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:59,770
remember I used to pretend I was an

423
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,840
astronaut and fly all over the place and

424
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,840
then when you grew up

425
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,720
you've got to be an astronaut

426
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,450
hmm do you think my playing about it had

427
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,440
something to do with it do you

428
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,150
I wonder knowing how to play well as one

429
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,380
of the most important things of all and

430
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,060
getting ready for the first day of

431
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,600

446
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:18,110

well lady elaine was scaring everybody

455
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,390
about school

456
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,169
do you know anybody who does that

457
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:02,230
sometimes older children will tell young

458
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:03,370
children all kinds of scary things about

459
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,419
school

460
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:09,820
well that's just not fair is it will

461
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:10,630
pretend about the first day of school in

462
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,460
the neighborhood of make-believe

463
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,049
tomorrow you have so many people who

464
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,530
care about you

465
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:22,480
we want you to like school because

466
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,780
there's so much you can learn that can

467
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:34,210
be so helpful to you for a long long

468
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:42,610
time I was just thinking that's one way

469
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:46,150
that i wrote my name Fred but before I

470
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:48,370
knew that I you should just write like

471
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:54,310
that just for practicing just for

472
00:25:48,370 --> 00:26:02,410
pretending and also

473
00:25:54,310 --> 00:26:13,690
this is another way i would show my name

474
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:22,570
show who I was

475
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:25,539
another fret and sometimes I wouldn't

476
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:31,389
feel like having a smile I just kind of

477
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:33,609
had straight like that

478
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:36,759
I always felt good when I could drop

479
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:40,749
pictures of myself just the way I was

480
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:49,539
feeling then also drop pictures of other

481
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:51,249
people that I loved think maybe I'll

482
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:55,659
leave these here and do some more

483
00:26:51,249 --> 00:27:01,419

00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:04,089

485
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:09,879

488
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:21,369
feeling you're growing inside and when

489
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:25,989

490
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:30,999
