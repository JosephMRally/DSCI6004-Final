part of your history you were born a

70
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,389
little baby

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,660
and you grew to be able to do the things

72
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:00,630
that you do now

73
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,030
do you know any little babies I brought

Oh

83
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:57,360
and to think everybody was a baby once

84
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,009
all human beings start out being babies

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,780
I wonder if you ever think about the

86
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,430
things that you can do now that you

87
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,900
couldn't do when you were a little baby

88
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,289
can you feed yourself now can you go to

89
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,940
the potty by yourself now can you say

90
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:18,060
some special words can you wait for a

91
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,169
while for something you want a lot

92
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:26,100
those are all things that babies can't

93
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:30,750
do those things show how much your

94
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:36,270

they're beautiful flowers to think the

McFeely screw those and would give them

131
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,360
to us when I was little and I gave some

132
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:12,290
flowers to somebody flowers that I found

133
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,540
like dandelions or daisies or weeds I

134
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:17,330
would just cram them into a glass and

135
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,730
give them i didn't know anything about

136
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,990
how to arrange flowers so that they

137
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:27,290
would look fancy but I always gave my

138
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,240
flowers with love and of course that's

139
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:33,650
the best arrangement for anything

140
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,980
McFeely obviously give there's with left

141
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:46,209
to just put those there and let's check

142
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:53,079
to see how the bean plant is doing

143
00:08:46,209 --> 00:09:01,089
takes time to grow doesn't it will give

144
00:08:53,079 --> 00:09:05,199
it some mist takes time and a lot of

145
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:08,520
patience but there are lots of things we

146
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:21,240
can do while we're waiting for growing

147
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:34,300
just the neighborhood of make-believe

148
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:40,000
factory what's this museum go around

149
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:45,550
Daniel's clock platters mound

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,270
that's a surprise x and Henrietta Street

151
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:53,980
there now last time we pretended that

152
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,720
the people and animals of the

153
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,510
neighborhood of make-believe were

154
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,470
concerned because there was some big

155
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,000
thing rolling from westwood toward where

156
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,670
they live

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,920
when she heard about it lady elaine

158
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,190
fairchilde thought she'd call Purple

159
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,740
Panda to see if anyone on the planet

160
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,050
purple knew anything about it

161
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,390
among other things let's make believe

162
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,650
that purple panda comes for a visit

163
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:25,840
right from Planet purple and what do you

164
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:29,260
suppose that big thing will look like

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,010
you think will be as big as a chair or a

166
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,190
table or a sink or a refrigerator

167
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:45,790
k trolley will think about those things

168
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:58,540
and the neighborhood of make-believe

169
00:10:45,790 --> 00:11:00,460

237
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:49,390
King Friday the 13th who lives over in

238
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,510
that castle has called the Royal troops

239
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,730
out and considers using force but we

240
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,550
were hoping that wouldn't be necessary

241
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:03,250
we're really peace-loving people around

242
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:05,110
here and as mayor of westwood I'd like

243
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,880
you to know that I'm certainly grateful

244
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:13,750
that you passed us by

245
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:16,959

246
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,290

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,820

teeter-totters keep talking peace and

250
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,720

to be adults this baby grew up to be

319
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:12,720

320
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:15,750
this baby boy grew up to be this man

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:30,510

322
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:42,420

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:09,360
hear this girl who grew up to be this

327
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:14,490
woman you see children can grow to be

328
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,050
adults outside and inside you used to

329
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,200
creep and crawl

330
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:22,260
well but then you learn to walk real

331
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,700
well there was a time you too and cry

332
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:31,350

342
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,120
when mom and dad refuse you

343
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:13,830
