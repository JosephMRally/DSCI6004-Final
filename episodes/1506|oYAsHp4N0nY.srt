fancier one here that's a marcus and

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,900
Stitch but it it would be a comfortable

196
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,360

197
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,130

[Music]

211
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:21,600
this is this is different from this you

212
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,360
know this is a wingtip this is a

213
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,240
moccasin tip that but if it doesn't fit

214
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,410
there's nothing happened no no no I

215
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,179
don't think there's any way you want to

216
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,819
consider that shoe because it's just

217
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:37,019
really not the right thing for all right

218
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:39,269
we'll try this song see how this goes

219
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,040
look better right away just the way your

220
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,170
foot slid right in there huh it feels

221
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,029
better care better

222
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,879
yeah I think you'd be a lot more

223
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,709
comfortable and this shoot for it just

224
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,119
and just take a couple steps see what

225
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,860
they feel like when your foot maybe you

226
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:56,819
might want to look in the mirror at them

227
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,949
oh that feels very good yeah they they

228
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:01,050
look like they fit your right good look

229
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:04,470
for something that you can walk and be

230
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,670
comfortable in how but it would be like

231
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,709
trying both on you maybe

232
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:14,819
yeah that's a good idea to try the other

233
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:17,790
one always yet it's always good to try

234
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:19,800
the left one man to because it can be a

235
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,249
variances in the two feet

236
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,160
yeah just the way they slide in there

237
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:28,259
they look look comfortable quickly fit

238
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,269

438
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:50,900
preparation and the fun

439
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:52,100
caring is hard sometimes for everyone

440
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,260
isn't it

441
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,420
everybody has some things that they

442
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,930
shouldn't have to share

443
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,700
do you have a blanket or a stuffed

444
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,300
animal or a pillow

445
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,700
well if it's extra special to you

446
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:11,210
that's something that you shouldn't have

447
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,760
to share that made me think I could use

448
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:20,419
this box for a bed

449
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:24,140

451
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:31,110

I'll just show you how to make a bed

454
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:40,710
with a shoebox very simple just put

455
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:46,320
something down a little bottom like that

456
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:52,440
don't have to have a real pillow like

457
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:58,890
that you just put some material one of

458
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:02,400
your toys in another blanket over it

459
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:07,530
there you have it and if you like you

460
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:12,809
could even sing to it it's you I like

461
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:17,490
it's not the things you wear it's not

462
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:19,330
the way you do your hair but it's you I

463
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:24,010

464
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:28,540
the way you are right now the way down

465
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:32,460
deep inside you not the things that hide

466
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:36,020
you not your toys

467
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:41,900
