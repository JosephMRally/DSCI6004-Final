272
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:24,370
[Music]

273
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:26,200
well you know Julie's been going to see

274
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,930
dr. Breck ever since she was a little

275
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,050
baby so they know each other very well

276
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,600
takes awhile for doctors and children to

277
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,460
get to know each other well and of

278
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,890
course Julie's mother got to be with her

279
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,960
the whole time and see everything that

280
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,260
was going on in that checkup

281
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,500
have you ever had a check-up like that

282
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,150
did any of it hurt well if a doctor has

283
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,360
to give you a shot

284
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:55,840
sometimes that does hurt doesn't shots

285
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,460
are like big pinches but the heart goes

286
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,130
away after a while

287
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,340
that's something that I know for sure

288
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,010
and another thing I know for sure is

289
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,920
that doctors can't tell what children

290
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,200
are thinking and feeling by looking

291
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,890
through their equipment or any other way

292
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,160
only you know what you're thinking and

293
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,500
feeling those are all things that you

294
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,700
can talk about with the people you love

295
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:30,930
