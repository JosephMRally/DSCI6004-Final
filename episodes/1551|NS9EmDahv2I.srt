output the seat right here

27
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:20,030
what I'm going to do is to plant this

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:25,459
seed so I have some some soil which i

29
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:31,790
will put in the pot never planned

30
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:37,040
anything

31
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:43,849
I like to play thing guess maybe that's

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:53,060
enough from now the seed right there

33
00:02:43,849 --> 00:03:11,700
then covered with more soil ok seed

34
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:15,390
little water

35
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,319
there now this seed has a chance of

36
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:24,390
growing into a tree and real oranges can

37
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:28,709
grow on that three oranges like this one

38
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:31,440
yes if you plan an orange seat you can

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,620
be sure that the tree that grows from it

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,700
will be an orange tree it would never be

41
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,840
an apple tree or a pear tree only an

42
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:57,750
orange tree cut this orange open so I

43
00:03:42,840 --> 00:04:05,579
can show you see any seeds there

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:10,980
here's one that's where seeds confirmed

45
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:22,560
right in

46
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:31,190
and if you squeeze an orange get some

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:37,990
orange juice

48
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:42,130
[Music]

49
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,740
like orange juice

50
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,530
most people don't have orange trees of

51
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,350
their own because it takes a long time

52
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,620
for them to grow and they have to grow

53
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,200
in special warm parts of the world so

54
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,630
most people who want orange juice have

55
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,560
to buy it in the store

56
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:10,390
I hope that's mr. McFeely let's go see

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:14,350
tell you why for this it is you have it

58
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,970
dunno mr. feeling hungry people make

59
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,710
orange juice after people make orange

60
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,210
juice would you be able to stay and

61
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,430
watch it with me have a few moments

62
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,520
because i know you know a lot about this

63
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,980
come on already this is what I wanted

64
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,560
you to see this is a film about how

65
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:38,950
people make orange juice so let's just

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:40,120
put a picture picture and what oranges

67
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,800
grow on trees

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,350
I was just telling my friends about that

69
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,400
while these trees are planted together

70
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,800
in a grove young trees make their fruit

71
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,050
a little the time are those your young

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,379
trees 'as

73
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,810
but as they grow they produce lots of

74
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:01,890
oranges like this full-grown tree

75
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,849

do you know anybody else who puts bread

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,290
in the breadbox

263
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:39,110
when I was a little boy and I would

264
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,270
plant something in the ground at first I

265
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,280
thought it would grow very fast and I'd

266
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:47,600
be able to see something come up in just

267
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,750
a few minutes but as I grew very slowly

268
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:56,660
i realized that plants grow very slowly

269
00:16:50,750 --> 00:17:00,800
to so little by little I learned to wait

270
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,330
and waiting is such an important thing

271
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,510
to learn to do

272
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,860
let's think of something to do while

273
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,540

new to do

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:18,860
let's try to think up a song while we're

276
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:20,180
way that's liberating and will be true

277
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,580
to you

you know it's really alright in fact

282
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:39,260
it's downright quite right to think of

283
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,750
something to view that specific for you
